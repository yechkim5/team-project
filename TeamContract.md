# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**
