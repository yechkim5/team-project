/* The Battle class is what ties two teams of Pokemon together and will be the
canvas that unites all other classes within our project. By week eleven, the
Battle class will have the following functionalities: calculate turn order,
keep track of modifiers on the stats and health of Pokemon in play, keep track
of the two active Pokemon in play and shepard the effects of moves from one Pokemon
to another.
